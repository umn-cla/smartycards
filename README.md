## Deploying

We use [deployer](https://deployer.org/) to deploy to an environment:

```sh
dep deploy <environment> --branch <branchname>
```

| environment | host                                                                       |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| dev         | [cla-smartycards-dev.oit.umn.edu](https://cla-smartycards-dev.oit.umn.edu) |
| stage       | [cla-smartycards-tst.oit.umn.edu](https://cla-smartycards-tst.oit.umn.edu) |
| prod        | [cla-smartcards-prd.oit.umn.edu](https://cla-smartcards-prd.oit.umn.edu)   |

Server configuration is managed via [UMN CLA's Ansible Playbook](https://github.com/umn-cla/ansible-rhel9).
