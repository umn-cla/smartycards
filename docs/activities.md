### Practice Mode

![Practice mode screen with a single card, an image of Boticelli's Birth of Venus. Below the card are 3 button for the user to click based on how well they know the card: ‚ùå, ü´§, ‚úÖ.](/img/practice-mode.png)

Study your flashcards with [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition).

You'll score cards based on the difficulty.

- ‚ùå ‚Äì Don't know it. See it again, soon.
- ü´§ ‚Äì Kinda know it, but could use more practice. See it again, later.
- ‚úÖ ‚Äì Know it. Done for this session.

Spaced repetition helps you study more efficiently. You'll see cards you don't know more regularly until you've learned them.

### Quiz Mode

SmartyCards will generate a quiz from your deck of flash cards.

::: info

SmartyCards uses [generative AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence) (GenAI) to create a question from your flashcard, so the quiz will be different each time. The quality of the GenAI questions and choices can vary with the content of the flashcards.

### Matching Game

![Matching game where users see a 4x4 grid of card sides: 8 famous paintings from art history, and 8 matching descriptions with authors, titles, and dates.](/img/matching-game.png)

Play a matching game with your flashcards. SmartyCards will select cards at random, and you'll match the front side with the back side.
