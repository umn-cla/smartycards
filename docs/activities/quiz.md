# Quiz Mode

In Quiz mode, SmartyCards will generate a practice quiz from your deck of flash cards using generative AI (genAI) to craft the questions.

With genAI, you'll get a new quiz with different choices each time, so you can practice on repeat.

::: warning
Quiz Mode uses AI to generate questions and answers based on your cards. Like any AI system, it might not always get things right. Currently, Quiz Mode will only generate text-based questions and answers. It wonâ€™t generate new images, audio, or video.
