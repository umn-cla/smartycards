# Quiz Mode

In Quiz mode, SmartyCards will generate a practice quiz from your deck of flash cards using generative AI (genAI) to craft the questions.

With genAI, you'll get a new quiz with different choices each time, so you can practice on repeat.

Like most AI, the quality of generated questions and choices is variable and will depend on the cards.
