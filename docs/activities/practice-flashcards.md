# Practice Flashcards

![Practice mode screen with a single card, an image of Boticelli's Birth of Venus. Below the card are 3 button for the user to click based on how well they know the card: ‚ùå, ü´§, ‚úÖ.](/img/practice-mode.png)

Practice mode lets you study your flashcards more efficiently with [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition).

With each card you'll score cards based on the difficulty, which determines when you'll see the card again. Difficult cards are repeated more often so that you can learn them more quickly.

- ‚ùå ‚Äì Don't know it. See it again, soon.
- ü´§ ‚Äì Kinda know it, but could use more practice. See it again, later.
- ‚úÖ ‚Äì Know it. Done for this session.

Over time, SmartyCards learns which cards you find most difficult, and prioritizes those cards the next practice session.

## Text-to-Speech

If you're learning a language or studying vocabulary, it can be helpful to hear words and phrases, instead of just reading them. SmartyCards can use AI-powered text-to-speech technology (TTS) to generate audio files to get with your cards.

To enable TTS, click the "three dots" icon in your deck and select "Settings," then enable Text-to-speech and click save. The next time you practice your cards, a speaker icon will allow you to hear the content of your card.
