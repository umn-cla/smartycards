Practice mode lets you study your flashcards more efficiently with [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition).

With each card you'll score cards based on the difficulty, which determines when you'll see the card again. Difficult cards are repeated more often so that you can learn them more quickly.

- ❌ – Don't know it. See it again, soon.
- 🫤 – Kinda know it, but could use more practice. See it again, later.
- ✅ – Know it. Done for this session.

Over time, SmartyCards learns which cards you find most difficult, and prioritizes those cards the next practice session.
