## Card Summary

![Summary of average score and number of attempts for each card](/img/deck-summary-report-on-cards.png)

The report will show the **average score** and **number of attempts** for each card. This is calculated from the results of all practice sessions from **all members**.

This is a great way to see which concepts might need reviewing in class.

::: info
**How are the scores calculated?**
Each time a student practices a card, a score is recorded based on the icon they click

- ✅ = 3 points
- 😕 = 2 points
- ❌ = 1 point

The score in the summary report is the average of all attempts among all deck members.

## Deck Participation

![summary report of deck member participation](/img/deck-summary-report-participation.png)

At the bottom of the report, you'll see a list of all members and which activities they've participated in.

### ✅ Practiced All Cards

This is checked when a members has used [practice mode](/activities/practice-flashcards) on **every** card in the deck **at least once**.

::: info
Practice all cards updates when the deck updates. So, if new cards are added to the deck, a user won't regain their check mark until those new cards are practiced at least once.
:::

### ✅ Quiz

This is checked when a user has tried the Quiz activity at least once.

Users only need to complete a single quiz. They do not need to be quizzed on every card to earn this checkmark.

### ✅ Matching Game

Similar to Quiz mode, this is checked when a user has tried the Matching game activity at least once.
